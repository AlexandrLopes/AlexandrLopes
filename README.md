# Hello, World! I'm Alexandre Lopes 

I'm a Junior Cloud Engineer turning coffee into infrastructure. Currently sharpening my skills in **Python** and **AWS** in Brazil. I am setting the stage for a new chapter in **Valencia, Spain (Apr/2026)** 🇪🇸. (Spouse of EU Citizen, full working rights).

I believe the best way to learn Cloud Engineering is by doing. That's why I created [**Cloud Engineering Labs**](https://github.com/AlexandrLopes/cloud-engineering-labs), a central hub where I document my experiments, automations, and projects.

My goal is simple: strictly avoid manual work by mastering Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and future-proofing systems with **Cloud Security**.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

* **Cloud & Infra:** AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM), Terraform (Learning)
* **Security:** Cloud Security Foundations, IAM Policies
* **Programming:** Python (Boto3, Automation scripts)
* **OS & Shell:** Linux/Unix (Bash & Zsh scripting)

### 🐍 Why Python?

You might ask: *"Why is a Cloud Engineer coding?"*
Because clicking buttons in the console is not scalable. I use **Python** to:
1.  Automate repetitive tasks (backups, cleanups).
2.  Manage AWS resources programmatically using **Boto3**.
3.  Build secure Serverless functions.
