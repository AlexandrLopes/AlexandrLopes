### 🚀 About Me & The Mission

I am a Junior Cloud Engineer setting the stage for a professional chapter in Europe. My philosophy is: **be the best although the ods**.

I believe the best way to learn Cloud Engineering is by *doing*. That's why I created **[Cloud Engineering Labs](https://github.com/AlexandrLopes/cloud-engineering-labs)**, and **[AWS Study Journey](https://github.com/AlexandrLopes/aws-study-journey)**  centrals hub's where I document my experiments, creating a bridge between theory and real-world implementation.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

**Cloud & Infrastructure**

### 🐍 Why Python?

You might ask: *"Why is a Cloud Engineer coding?"* Because clicking buttons in the console is not scalable. I use Python to:
1.  **Automate** repetitive maintenance tasks (backups, cleanups).
2.  **Manage** AWS resources programmatically using **Boto3**.
3.  **Build** secure Serverless functions (Lambda).

### 🎯 Career Goals & Opportunities

While my foundation is in **Cloud Engineering**, my long-term vision is to specialize in **Cloud Security (SecOps)**. I am passionate about building infrastructures that are not only automated but secure by design.

I am currently **open to Trainee, Junior** where I can contribute with my Python/AWS skills while absorbing best practices from experienced teams.

* **Availability:** Immediate (Remote) or On-site in Madrid, Spain (from Apr/2026)
* **Languages:** Portuguese (Native), English (Professional Working Proficiency), Spanish (Learning)
